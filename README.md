# Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning
Main Project

**Plant disease detection** plays a crucial role in ensuring the health and productivity of crops. It involves identifying and diagnosing diseases that affect plants, enabling farmers and researchers to take timely and appropriate actions to prevent or mitigate the spread of infections. The proposed system for plant disease detection using deep learning, specifically utilizing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with the **EfficientNet-B0 model**, offers several salient features

The **system's objectives** include accurate disease identification across various plant species, early detection to prevent disease spread, a user-friendly **interface for easy image uploads and diagnoses**, high accuracy ,reliability and scalability. Detect diseases in plants at early stages to prevent their spread and minimize damage. By using machine learning  algorithms and other techniques the project aims to identify signs of diseases before they cause significant damage to crops.

To detect unhealthy regions of plant leaves. Classification of plant leaf diseases using texture features. To analyze the leaf infection. Increase accuracies using large dataset to train the **Algorithm and maximize epoch values** . By using **EfficientNet models achieve both higher accuracy and better efficiency over existing CNNs.**


The aim of this project is to develop a plant disease detection system using the EfficientNet-B0 model, which is implemented in **TensorFlow framework**. The proposed system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately identify and classify various diseases affecting plants.
